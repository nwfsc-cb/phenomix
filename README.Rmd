## zoidtmb

`zoidtmb` is an implementation of the `zoid` package in TMB, using marginal maximum likelihood instead of Bayesian estimation. This may be particularly useful for datasets with large dimensions. 

The syntax of fitting models matches `zoid`, and can be done with 

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit <- fit_zoidTMB(formula = formula, # required formula
                   design_matrix = design_matrix, # optional covariates
                   data_matrix = data.matrix, # required data matrix
                   overdispersion = FALSE, # optional estimated overdispersion
                   overdispersion_sd = 5, # optional penalty/prior on overdispersion
                   prior_sd = NA) # optional prior/penalty on fixed effects 
```

Parameter estimates and uncertainty can be extracted from 
```{r eval=FALSE}
fit$sdreport
```

Derived quantities (means) are provided with `fit$mu` and uncertainties `fit$mu_se`.
